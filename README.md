## Training
Refer the notebook: [train/mbnet_train.ipynb](https://github.com/andriyadi/StarWars-Chars-AIClassifier/blob/master/train/mbnet_train.ipynb)

Also refer the preparation steps [here](https://github.com/andriyadi/Maix-LogoClassifier#train-your-model)

## Notes
Currently, MaixPy only supports kmodel version 3. So, I have to use old `nncase` to convert tflite to kmodel file.
